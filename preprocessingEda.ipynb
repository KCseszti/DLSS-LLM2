again\\nAnd pray it all away\\nWe all the way\\n[Chorus]\\nDiamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say\\nUnique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith\\nMade a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?\\nRolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'\\nIntroverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business\\nIntroverted, these days, introverted, these days\\nPlain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes\\nPlain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes\\n[Verse 1]\\nMaking Salat, I ain't miss a beat\\nPraise to Allah, made it out the clink\\nAlhamdulillah, praise be to God\\nBig booty freak, givin' a massage\\nLookin' in the mirror, lookin' at a star\\nShe get on her knees and look up at a star\\nRemember being broke, wishin' on a star\\nOut the mud, no one givin' us a start\\nWhite gold, iced out, Audemars\\nForeign car, push button, autostart\\nRest and relaxation not involved, goin' hard Rolls Royce, R&R\\nWonder why these niggas hate me?\\nProbably 'cause they know they ain't me\\nI ain't never been a gang member, Illinois labeled me a gang chief\\nPolitical spear, Judge Linehan racist, I\\u2019m bein' sentenced\\nWrongful conviction, broke bread and lied to me\\nGave him a quarter ticket, he did not appeal it\\nLayin' in my cell, lookin' at the ceiling\\nI'm on a division, me and all the killers\\nThrowin' shit and piss on all the staff members\\nEven got the warden, that\\u2019s why they had to ship us\\n[Chorus]\\nDiamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say\\nUnique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith\\nMade a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?\\nRolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'\\nIntroverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business\\nIntroverted, these days, introverted, these days\\nPlain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes\\nPlain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes\\n[Verse 2]\\n(Vroom Vroom) This a Camaro\\nI'm rockin' Bread Winners' fitness apparel\\nSexy receptionist look like a dancer\\nPardon me ma'am, I'm demandin' some answers\\nNot makin' plans that was made to be cancelled\\nCoulda said, \\\"Hi,\\\" you know I'm kinda bashful\\nUnwillin' to fuck with me, why is you starin'?\\nGot some real niggas and we into sharin'\\nConservative aura, I glow in the dark\\nI speak in no English, I'm talkin' numerics\\nIslamic fashion out in Paris, overseas when I travel, McLaren\\nCome to think this was me in the alley\\nMickie D's we was purchasin' salads\\nChi-raq, buyin' chicken from Harold's\\nJerk Villa curry chicken and cabbage\\nFresh yams, politic'n with family\\nI got status, gotta catch me in traffic\\nMakin' music, but I'm really a trapper\\nBooty club, 'bout to fuck up a sandwich\\nA hundred bands, if you ain't catch him, what's happenin'?\\nMaceo Haziz, told him we platinum\\nAmsterdam on the tram, we in transit\\nWord to God, I'ma fuck a Kardashian, action\\n[Chorus]\\nDiamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say\\nUnique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith\\nMade a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?\\nRolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'\\nIntroverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business\\nIntroverted, these

deed to the land, but it ain't my ground\\nThis is God's country\\nWe pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallin\\n'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money\\nWe put it back in the plate\\nI guess that's why they call it God's country\\n[Chorus]\\nI saw the light in a sunrise\\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside\\nGettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'\\nSaved by the sound of the been found\\nDixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\\nThe Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\\nThis is God's country\\n[Verse 2]\\nWe turn the dirt and work until the week's done\\nWe take a break and break bread on Sunday\\nThen do it all again\\n'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)\\n[Chorus]\\nI saw the light in a sunrise\\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside\\nGettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'\\nSaved by the sound of the been found\\nDixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\\nThe Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\\nThis is God's country\\n[Interlude]\\n(God's country)\\n[Bridge]\\nI don't care what my headstone reads\\nOr what kind of pinewood box I end up in\\nWhen it's my time, lay me six feet deep\\nIn God's country (Yeah)\\n[Chorus]\\nI saw the light in a sunrise\\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside\\nGettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Dogs runnin')\\nSaved by the sound of the been found\\nDixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\\nThe Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\\nThis is God's country (God's country)\\nYeah, I saw the light in a sunrise\\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside\\nGettin' baptized in holy

deed to the land, but it ain't my ground\\nThis is God's country\\nWe pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallin\\n'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money\\nWe put it back in the plate\\nI guess that's why they call it God's country\\n[Chorus]\\nI saw the light in a sunrise\\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside\\nGettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'\\nSaved by the sound of the been found\\nDixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\\nThe Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\\nThis is God's country\\n[Verse 2]\\nWe turn the dirt and work until the week's done\\nWe take a break and break bread on Sunday\\nThen do it all again\\n'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)\\n[Chorus]\\nI saw the light in a sunrise\\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside\\nGettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'\\nSaved by the sound of the been found\\nDixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\\nThe Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\\nThis is God's country\\n[Interlude]\\n(God's country)\\n[Bridge]\\nI don't care what my headstone reads\\nOr what kind of pinewood box I end up in\\nWhen it's my time, lay me six feet deep\\nIn God's country (Yeah)\\n[Chorus]\\nI saw the light in a sunrise\\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside\\nGettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Dogs runnin')\\nSaved by the sound of the been found\\nDixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\\nThe Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\\nThis is God's country (God's country)\\nYeah, I saw the light in a sunrise\\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside\\nGettin' baptized in holy
